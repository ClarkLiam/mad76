# MAD76 Kit

![image](mad76.png)

  - Turboracing 1:76 RC cars (<https://www.turboracing.net>)

  - Raspberry Pi 5 runs Raspberry Pi OS (Debian Linux)

  - Raspberry Pi Global Shutter Camera is mounted on a tripod

  - MAD76 Box houses Raspberry Pi, MAD76 IO (PCB), and Turboracing
    remote controllers

  - MAD76 Driving Stack is implemented as software packages in
    middleware ROS2 (<https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/index.html>)
    
      - Computer Vision reads in frames from top-view camera and detects
        cars by ArUco markers
    
      - Multi-Object Tracking computes the carsâ€™ velocities
    
      - Motion Planning computes the optimal trajectories for the cars
    
      - Motion Control controls the cars on the trajectories
    
      - Optional race simulation

  - MAD76 Driving Stack is programmed in C++ and Python

  - MAD76 Driving Stack may run in a distributed computer environment
    (Raspberry Pi and Linux-PCs)

  - Optional Linux-PCs are for race simulation, programming,
    MATLAB/Simulink simulation, deep neural network training

  - MAD76 IO is designed in Eagle

  - MAD76 Driving Stack and MAD76 IO are open source

  - Contributions are greatly welcome
