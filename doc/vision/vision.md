Markers {#sec:markers}
=======

Marker Generation {#subsec:generation}
-----------------

![image](markers.jpg){width="\\textwidth"}

-   The cars are tracked with ArUco markers.

-   Computer vision computes the cartesian coordinates and the yaw angle
    of the cars.

-   The markers are generated with the OpenCV ArUco library.

-   A custom ArUco dictionary of 8 markers with a size of 3x3 bits is
    used to increase the reliablity of computer vision.

-   TODO: source code

-   The markers IDs are from 0 to 7, 0 to 3 in the first row from left
    to right, and 4 to 7 in the second row.

-   Print the markers on a snow-white, 80 grams paper.

    -   Make sure to configure high quality printing.

    -   Scale the printing such that the black area of the markers have
        a height and width of 21mm, each.

-   Cut the markers as squares including approx. 5mm boundaries.

-   Note the marker IDs before cutting with a thin pencil on the
    boundaries, because you will need these IDs later on.

Frame Markers {#subsec:frame}
-------------

![image](track.png){width="\\textwidth"}

-   Four frame markers define the coordinate system of the track.

-   All coordinates of cars and track are measured in meters.

-   The origin $(s_{01},s_{02})=(0,0)$ is at the center point of marker
    ID4.

-   Place frame markers with IDs 4, 5, 6, 7 at corners of board as
    depicted in figure.

    -   It is recommended to apply the distances as dispicted.

    -   Although modified distances may be later configured in the ROS2
        package `mbmadvisionaruco`.

    -   The distances are measured at the marker center points.

    -   The markers must form a rectangle.

    -   The sequence of the marker IDs is essential.
